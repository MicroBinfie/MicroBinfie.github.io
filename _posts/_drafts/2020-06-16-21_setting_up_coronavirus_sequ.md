# 21 Setting up coronavirus sequencing for real-time public health surveillance

We chat to Justin O'Grady and Andrew Page on how to get a SARS-CoV-2 sequencing effort off the ground in the middle of a pandemic and go on to sequence 1,500 genomes in 2 months. The Quadram institute is one of 16 sequencing centres in the UK which are part of the COVID-19 genome sequencing consortium. Things we touch off include COG, contamination issues, the people, and bioinformatics.
