# 62 Campylobacter: the fussy little pathogen

Our guest today is Dr Ozan Gundogdu and he gives us a crash course in food borne pathogen Campylobacter. If you've ever had a dodgy tummy after eating undercooked chicken, Campy is probably the cause.

Ozan leads the foodborne enteric pathogen group at the London school of hygiene and tropical medicine. Where they study the physiology and pathogenesis of Campylobacter and other related enteric microorganisms like Listeria and Vibrio.  His background is in Molecular Biology and Computer Science and he completed his PhD at LSHTM (London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine) in 2011.
